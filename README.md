# hashed
Simple scripts aimed monitoring a directory for any changes.

Create Baseline
The generate.py script can be used to create a baseline of your chosen directory. The script has some basic functionality to show progress when scanning larger directories. The baseline should be securely stored in a read-only location where possible.

Options
-d  Path to the directory you want to scan
-o  Path and filename for the baseline output

Example Usage
python.exe .\generate.py -d c:\path\to\directory -o c:\hashed\output\baseline.csv

Alternatively, you can simply run the script and it will walk you through providing the required information.

Compare to Baseline
The compare.py script can then be used to scan the directory and compare it to the baseline that was previously generated. I have not included functionality to send out change notifications as this is varies based on how the scripts are used, the script output the results to a report and print a quick overview to the terminal on completion.

Options
-d  Path to the directory you want to scan
-b  Path and baseline filename that you want to compare the results to
-r  Path and report filename for the results

Example Usage
python.exe .\compare.py -d c:\path\to\directory -b \\hashed\baseline.csv -r \\hashed\report\report.csv

Alternatively, you can simply run the script and it will walk you through providing the required information.
